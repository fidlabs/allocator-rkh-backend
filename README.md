This repository contains the source code for the backend service responsible for managing the Filecoin Plus program.

## Project Overview

The `filecoin-plus-backend` service manages the entire lifecycle of allocator applications within the Filecoin Plus
program. It is designed as an event-driven system to automate and streamline the process from initial application
submission to final approval. The system starts with a GitHub pull request (PR), which triggers the subsequent automated
workflows, aligning with the requirement that all application-related activities are managed via GitHub.

The backend service is responsible for the following key functionalities:

- **Application Submission**: Accepting allocator applications from users and submitting them to the Filecoin-Allocator
  registry repository.
- **KYC Process**: Managing the KYC process for applicants.
- **Governance Review**: Facilitating the governance review process for applications.
- **Root Key Holder Approval**: Managing the on-chain approval process for root key holders.

## System Architecture

- Node JS
- Typescript
- MongoDB for storing application data
- RabbitMQ for message queuing
- Express API
- Worker services

### Application Submission

- Applications are submitted via a Form connected to an Airtable
- For GDPR compliance, the application data is split into two different views, a public and private view.
- The public data is fetched by the Filecoin Plus backend and stored in a MongoDB database. The data is fetched using
  the [airtable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/airtable) NPM package.
- Afterwards the backend will create a PR application to the Filecoin-Allocator registry repository. containing the
  formatted json file with the public data.

### Know Your Client (KYC) Process

- After the application is accepted the applicant will be provided a link to the Zyphe platform to complete KYC and
  human verification.
- The KYC process is done through the Zyphe platform. The Zyphe platform will provide a KYC status to the Filecoin Plus
  backend.

### Governance Review

- After the KYC is accepted, governance team will review and provide feedback on allocator applications.

### Root Key Holder Approval

- Root Key Holders are responsible for auditing the diligence and bookkeeping of the governance team before approving
  on-chain DataCap reqeusts to allocators. These requests can be for new allocators, to supply more DataCap to existing
  allocators, or to remove DataCap from an allocator.

#### Running

You can run the Docker containers by running the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the backend service, database and message broker.
By default, the backend service will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

After you are done, you can stop the containers by running:

```bash
docker compose down
```
